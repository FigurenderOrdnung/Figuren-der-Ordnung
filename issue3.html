  <h1>Issue III – Softpower</h1>
  <h2>The Fading of a Concept</h2>

  <p><em>
    The authors thank Dirk Baecker for an important remark that helped clarify
    the line of argument developed here.
  </em></p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The notion of soft power has deeply shaped Western reflections on global influence. Yet the seemingly
    reassuring idea that political effectiveness can be exercised through cultural attractiveness, values, or
    symbolic presence hardly holds in the twenty-first century. Between the United States and China a competition
    unfolds that is no longer defined by images, narratives, or forms of self-presentation, but by the shaping of
    the conditions under which access to the world becomes possible in the first place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Against this background, soft power appears not as a gentle alternative to military hard power, but as the
    semantic remainder of a past epistemo-geopolitical order. For decades, the United States produced a global
    present whose media, cultural, and epistemic infrastructure emerged primarily from Hollywood, Silicon Valley,
    news agencies, and universities. This constellation made soft power appear as a natural expression of American
    modernity. China, by contrast, pursues a structurally different approach: less visible, less narrative, but
    deeply administrative. The central question of contemporary power is therefore no longer which model appears
    more attractive, but which model defines the operative conditions under which connectivity, visibility,
    movement, and cooperation become possible at all.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Who Narrates the World? Towards a Geopolitical Theory of Culture</h2>
  <p>
    Frédéric Martel has shown that American soft power does not lie in the exportability of a particular cultural
    form, but in the ability to produce global presence. Film industries, media conglomerates, streaming platforms,
    digital operating systems, and universities form an ensemble that exerts influence less through state planning
    than through structural omnipresence. This presence generates access to the world: anyone seeking information
    on current affairs, listening to music, or following the cultural rituals of modernity moves—often without
    noticing—within infrastructures shaped by the United States. Soft power was the aesthetic surface of this
    deeper structural constellation.
  </p>

  <h2>2. The Limits of Cultural Attractiveness – Vishakha Desai and the World as a Circulatory Space</h2>
  <p>
    A perspective that recognized this shift early on can be found in the work of Vishakha Desai. She insists that
    cultural attractiveness has never been a one-directional flow, but has always been shaped by reciprocal
    processes of influence and adaptation. From this perspective, soft power does not appear as the export of a
    national identity, but as a circular process of cultural reception and transformation. Precisely for that
    reason the concept loses analytical sharpness once the global order is no longer structured by clear centers
    and peripheries. The world in which soft power functioned was a world with a distinct epistemic and aesthetic
    center; the present, by contrast, is marked by relational, situational, and increasingly administratively
    mediated forms of power.
  </p>

  <h2>3. China and the Power of Conditions – From Cultural Offer to Operative World Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    China pursues a logic of power that is hardly mediated culturally at all. Over the past twenty years it has
    developed a system that exercises influence not by attraction, but by shaping the surrounding conditions.
    Science policy, technological standard-setting, urban governance technologies, digital payment systems,
    logistics architectures, and international cooperation protocols form an administrative world model that does
    not seek to persuade but to bind. It does not produce images but requirements; not cultural horizons but
    operative conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    At exactly this point the concept of soft power begins to erode. It presupposes a world in which cultural
    offers of identification represent the crucial resource of international politics. Yet the present is no longer
    ordered by narratives, but by standards and procedures. Whoever defines 5G standards defines the possibilities
    of communication; whoever controls supply chains defines the structure of economic relations; whoever expands
    urban sensor technology defines forms of social coexistence. Soft power attempts to describe this world with
    the language of proximity, seduction, and attractiveness—and fails before a reality shaped by technical
    architecture.
  </p>

  <h2>4. The Internal Tensions of American Soft Power</h2>
  <p>
    The internal tensions of American soft power become visible as soon as the silent presuppositions on which it
    rested begin to crumble. Three conditions sustained this model for decades: the global dominance of American
    media and information infrastructures, the cultural innovative capacity of the United States, and the epistemic
    status of American universities as seemingly natural centers of knowledge production. All three fields are now
    fragmenting. Digital infrastructures are no longer unequivocally U.S.-centered; cultural production has become
    globally distributed and hybrid; and the academic system is pluralizing in ways that undermine traditional
    epistemic hierarchies. What once appeared as self-evident attractiveness must today be defended by
    administrative instruments—export controls, visa restrictions, sanction regimes, and security bureaucracies.
  </p>
  <p>
    This reveals the paradoxical movement by which soft power consolidates itself: it resorts to harder means at
    precisely the moment when its cultural power of persuasion is waning.
  </p>

  <h2>5. China’s Alternative Modernity – Not Representation but Structural Integration</h2>
  <p>
    China does not seek a comparable way out via the intensification of its own attractiveness. Chinese cultural
    policy does not operate with the aim of global recognition, but with the aim of global binding. Scientific,
    technological, and administrative strategies merge into a societal apparatus that is designed to shape
    world-conditions. The Chinese model is not primarily concerned with cultural representation, but with structural
    influence: the design of epistemic spaces, the control of future technologies, the expansion of logistics
    architectures, and the stabilization of regimes of cooperation that are based not on values but on standards.
  </p>
  <p>
    This model operates beyond the semantic opposition between hard and soft power—and precisely for this reason it
    withdraws the ground from the old soft power vocabulary. The blind spots of Western debate become apparent when
    China continues to be read in terms derived from the soft power discourse of the 1990s. Concepts such as
    attractiveness, trust, image, or cultural radiance miss those layers of Chinese power that do not aim at
    generating consent but at defining conditions of connectivity. The question of contemporary centers of power
    can only be answered if we no longer describe them via cultural identities, but via technological and
    administrative orders.
  </p>

  <h2>6. The Epistemic Shift – From Symbolic World-Images to Technical Parameters</h2>
  <p>
    This shift points to a deeper epistemic dynamic: the world is no longer structured primarily through symbolic
    representations, but through operative infrastructures. Standards, protocols, algorithms, and networks assume
    the ordering functions that were once associated with narratives, values, or political programs. Soft power was
    the cultural expression of an epistemic order that relied on the persuasive force of symbolic forms. The
    present, by contrast, places its trust in the effectiveness of functional structures.
  </p>
  <p>
    This development can be seen most clearly in that epistemological field which in the West was long marked by
    the illusion of a universal modernity. Since the end of the Cold War it seemed self-evident that scientific
    rationality, technological innovation, liberal institutions, and global communication systems were not only
    dominated by the West, but that their form and mode of operation could be derived from the Western model.
    Soft power was the semantic crown of this self-understanding. Yet the emergence of a second epistemic center—a
    Chinese-structured, administratively grounded, technologically organized world model—has fundamentally shaken
    this order.
  </p>
  <p>
    China does not project world-images; it sets world-parameters. It does not offer an alternative to liberal
    democracy, but builds an environment in which decisions about the future are no longer taken in the register of
    political representation, but in the register of technical operationality. The “return of history” thus
    manifests itself not in a clash of ideologies, but in a competition between different constructions of
    reality. What matters is no longer the ability to represent the world aesthetically, but the ability to
    stabilize those technical and administrative horizons within which reality becomes experienceable at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    The question of who shapes the future is identical with the question of who defines the standards, trains the
    algorithms, controls the data spaces, and designs the procedures that determine the structure of knowledge.
    Soft power cannot catch up with this transformation, because its conceptual framework remains on the surface.
    It describes political power as attractiveness, but it does not grasp that operative depth level at which the
    structural conditions of attractiveness are already being produced.
  </p>
  <p>
    Contemporary power no longer relies on consent, but on the pre-structuring of conditions. Power arises when
    access is created or denied, when infrastructures define the pathways of action, and when administrative
    apparatuses determine how knowledge, communication, or mobility become possible at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this light, the old distinctions between hard and soft power become questionable. The United States resorts
    to administrative and regulatory means that traditionally counted as elements of hard power in order to
    stabilize its waning cultural dominance. China, in turn, exercises a form of hard power that appears soft
    because it does not manifest itself in military interventions, but in the imposition of standards, procedures,
    and infrastructures. The geopolitical landscape is shaped by a form of structural power that operates beyond
    the old dichotomy. This structural power is invisible, impersonal, technical—and precisely for that reason
    thoroughly effective.
  </p>

  <h2>7. A Theory of Power in the Age of Infrastructure – Foucault, Arendt, Luhmann, Benjamin</h2>
  <p>
    After the previous chapters have sketched the geopolitical, infrastructural, and temporal transformations, we
    can now ask how the very concept of power has changed. Classical political theory in the twentieth century was
    shaped by notions that focused on subjects, discourses, and collective capacities to act. The present shifts
    these axes. Four figures of thought—Foucault, Arendt, Luhmann, Benjamin—make it possible to see that soft power
    was not merely a political term tied to persuasion and culture, but the expression of a historical formation of
    power that is now dissolving.
  </p>
  <p>
    The theoretical depth of this shift becomes visible along these lines of analysis. Foucault’s understanding of
    power as dispositif—as a configuration of possibilities, probabilities, and steering spaces—already pointed out
    that power never functioned primarily as overt domination, but as a structuring of the conditions of action.
    Soft power was an expression of such a dispositive form of power: it operated through cultural proximity,
    attraction, and implicit recognition. Yet the present is shaped by a mode of power that no longer targets
    subjects, but the pathways that are available to those subjects. The dispositif thus migrates from the level of
    discourse to that of infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hannah Arendt’s distinction between power and domination marks a similar transition. For Arendt, power means
    acting in concert—the capacity of a group to shape a common world. Domination, by contrast, is the logic of
    apparatuses, bureaucracies, administrative enforcement. Soft power was, in theoretical terms, a concept of
    power: it rested on the idea of shared worldviews and common cultural horizons. Today’s geopolitical order,
    however, is shaped by structures of domination that do not rely on consent but on functionality. China embodies
    this model in its purest form: it does not offer a narrative, but a procedure. The United States, which long
    defined itself through a power-based self-understanding, now responds with modes of domination to the loss of
    its cultural self-evidence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Luhmann’s theory of functional differentiation finally provides the analytical lens that renders the end of the
    soft power semantics particularly clear. Soft power could only operate in a world in which culture, politics,
    science, media, and economy functioned as separate systems. Today’s configurations of power dissolve these
    separations. China has long since developed a model that organizes science, technology, state, and industry
    within a single, highly integrated complex. But the United States, too, is moving—albeit involuntarily—in this
    direction whenever it restricts scientific cooperation, controls technological exports, or politicizes
    university partnerships. Soft power, understood as influence through cultural attractiveness, loses its
    footing in this post-differentiated order.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Walter Benjamin’s notion of the aestheticization of politics, finally, we encounter the historical core of
    the soft power model. The United States had developed the capacity to stage political power as cultural
    surface—as pop culture, as modernity, as narrative. This aestheticization was the central medium through which
    American world order was legitimized. China, by contrast, does not aestheticize. It technicizes. The legitimacy
    of the Chinese model rests less on myths, images, or symbols than on reliability, calculability, and long-term
    planning. Where domination becomes aesthetic, soft power emerges; where domination becomes technical, it
    disappears. For this reason, the Chinese architecture of the future marks not only a political but also an
    aesthetic caesura: soft power loses its stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Taken together, these four perspectives reveal that we are not merely dealing with the end of soft power, but
    with a transition to a new formation of power: a form of power that no longer legitimizes itself by
    attractiveness, but by shaping the space of possibilities itself. The future of geopolitical order will not be
    decided by ideologies, but by the structures that determine who can reach, address, integrate, or exclude whom.
    Soft power was the stage. Infrastructures are the new light.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Platform Empire vs. Administrative State – Infrastructures as Geopolitical Actors</h2>
  <p>
    Against this background, it becomes clear why the geopolitical present is less characterized by competing
    political programs than by competing infrastructures. The decisive differences run not between liberal and
    authoritarian state forms, but between different modes of organizing the world. The United States acts as a
    platform empire whose power runs through visibility, communication, and the mediated self-description of the
    world; China evolves into an administrative state that, through standards, protocols, and technological
    specifications, determines the operative structure within which the world can be experienced as a functional
    whole. Soft power—a term from a time when the stage of history was still imagined in the mode of global
    narratability—can no longer capture this constellation.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this situation it becomes apparent that forms of power are always tied to the semantic horizons that render
    their validity plausible. Soft power functioned as long as the world could be thought in the medium of cultural
    attractiveness. Once political effectiveness is mediated primarily through technical and administrative
    parameters, the semantics of “soft” power loses its ground. Concepts do not die because they vanish, but
    because the world they described disappears. They become rhetorical after-images that promise orientation while
    simultaneously obscuring emerging orders. Soft power is such a concept: a theoretical device that has outlived
    its own epoch and thus misleads.
  </p>
  <p>
    The shift from cultural attractiveness to administratively managed conditions of access is nowhere more evident
    than in the structure of the network society itself. In a world in which social, economic, and epistemic
    processes are mediated by digital platforms, power migrates to the level of inclusion logics. What counts is
    no longer the ability to generate consent, but the capacity to define connectivity. Access becomes the central
    resource of the present—and thus the central form of political power.
  </p>
  <p>
    The logic of this administered inclusion now shapes the structure of the political present. Access no longer
    arises in the medium of cultural proximity, but in the medium of technical compatibility. Those who wish to
    participate in processes of global exchange need not be convinced by a cultural model; they must inscribe
    themselves into its operative conditions. In this respect, the modes of operation of platform empires and
    administrative states resemble one another, even though they embody historical, institutional, and political
    opposites. Both models generate reality through procedures: through algorithms, standards, systems of
    registration, and logics of connection that determine who is visible, mobile, capable of acting, or epistemically
    effective.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this constellation soft power persists only as a semantic remainder. It recounts stories of attraction while
    the operative reality has long been shaped by architectures of access. These architectures constitute the
    inconspicuous yet thoroughly effective structure that defines the scope of action of global actors.
    Attractiveness becomes a rhetorical façade that conceals the fact that contemporary power lies in the
    organization of conditions, not in the production of desirable images.
  </p>
  <p>
    Against this backdrop, soft power appears as a concept that has outlived its own epoch. It is attached to a
    world held together by the dominance of American cultural industries, by the relative uniformity of global
    media spaces, and by the epistemic hegemony of Western knowledge systems. The present, by contrast, is
    characterized by a multipolar, technically fragmented, and administratively organized order in which power no
    longer articulates itself through narratives but through the control of functional conditions. The world is not
    seduced; it is bound.
  </p>

  <h2>Interlude – How Concepts Die</h2>
  <p>
    Concepts are tools of orientation. They arise because the world is too complex to be grasped without
    abstractions. They make thinking easier by stripping away what seems inessential and leaving an essence with
    which one can operate. Schopenhauer was right: concepts are like logarithms—condensations that save mental
    labour. Yet in this lies their fragility as well. They age. They lose their object-reference. And they die—often
    imperceptibly, while they continue to be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    The concept of soft power belongs to those semantic forms that are tied to the conditions of their emergence.
    It owes its existence to an epoch in which the United States was not only culturally dominant, but functioned
    as the self-evident epistemic and political center of the world. Soft power was the narrative of this
    dominance in aesthetic form: the world follows not because it must, but because it wants to. Yet this narrative
    now confronts a world that no longer exists in that way. The concept persists while its object has vanished. In
    this gap confusion arises: soft power appears to describe what in fact already operates in a different manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Concepts die quietly when the world they once ordered transforms. They become remnants of an earlier way of
    thinking that continues to resonate even though its premises have become fragile. Soft power clings to a model
    in which attractiveness is a geopolitical asset. The present, however, is defined by structural power,
    infrastructural influence, and administrative integration. Terms such as structural power, infrastructural
    power, or epistemic hegemony describe a world in which attractiveness is no longer the central resource. They
    are less elegant, less pleasing, but they touch the core of contemporary political reality.
  </p>
  <p>
    When dead concepts continue to circulate, political risks arise. Soft power conveys a sense of Western
    capacity to act that is no longer realised. It permits adherence to moral self-images while the operative
    reality is already determined by technological apparatuses, administrative procedures, and global functional
    chains. The United States clings to the term because it embodies the aesthetic residue of its cultural
    universality. Europe clings to it because relinquishing it would mean acknowledging its own structural
    powerlessness. China hardly uses the term at all—and that is its strategic advantage. It operates in the next
    world while the West speaks of the previous one.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dead concept does not disappear. It wanders as a shadow figure through the present. It reassures, because
    it suggests a world in which political power works through persuasion. Yet reality is no longer negotiated in
    aesthetic terms. It is produced administratively, technologically, infrastructurally. Soft power is the echo of
    an order that has vanished. An echo with political effects.
